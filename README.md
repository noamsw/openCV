## Additional Notes

- **Model Training and Accuracy**: Acknowledge that the model achieved around 56% accuracy, likely due to undertraining and insufficient data.
- **Deep Learning with TensorFlow**: Plan to utilize TensorFlow for deep learning tasks, focusing on data normalization rather than resizing images.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Intend to leverage platforms like CANDLE for free GPU resources to train deep learning models efficiently.
