our model was not amazing, around 56% this is propbably as a result of undertraining.
we did not have a enough data to train on. therefore the model is not super accurate
learn about deep models in openCV.openCV is usually used for normalizing the data.
we will only resize befoe. we will use tensor flow to instantiate a deep learning model
we will use candle for a free gpu to train our model
